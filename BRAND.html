        <h2>STORY</h2>
        <h3>South Korean entertainment star G-DRAGON (G-Dragon) personal brand, established in 2015, relying on personal fame and a more unique aesthetic, get more good reputation, and has launched a joint list with a number of brands.</h3>
        <h3>PEACEMINUSONE is a combination of three words. There are two different opinions about the brand name. The first ONE is from a literal perspective, "PEACE" represents the peaceful utopian world, "MINUS" the real world with insufficient meaning, and "one" is the intersection of these two worlds. Therefore, PEACEMINUSONE is G-DRAGON's own imaginary world, and it is also his project to integrate a variety of creative ideas into fashion. The second statement is from a graphic point of view, meaning that the peace Logo minus a stroke, it becomes the PEACEMINUSONE Logo, which is the abbreviation of GD.</h3>

        <h3>Since his debut, G-DRAGON has not only made great achievements in Punk and Hip-Hop music, becoming a superstar in the music industry, but also a pivotal Icon in the fashion industry. G-DRAGON has its own unique views on art and fashion. In 2015, G-DRAGON held an art exhibition named "PEACEMINUSONE" in Seoul Art Museum, South Korea, and cooperated with many artists at home and abroad to let everyone feel the unique spark of music inspiration and art collision. In 2016, PEACEMINUSONE launched a single product, designed by G-Dragon stylist GeeEun, and published a series of simple black and white hat, T-Shirt, hoodie and other single products.</h3>
